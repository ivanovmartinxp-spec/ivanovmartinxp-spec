# Hi, I'm Martin 👋
## Mid QA Engineer at Sirma Group. I test platforms with a focus on quality and client satisfaction.

## :paperclip: About
I am a Mid QA Engineer with almost half a decade of experience as a QA, currently working at Sirma Group for clients in the Logistics Verticals, such as Ligentia and DHL. I specialize in creating clear test cases and test documentation, identifying critical 
defects, and ensuring product quality across the full testing lifecycle. I work closely with developers and product teams to deliver stable, user-focused software. I am continuously improving myself by researching new test processes through automation and best 
practices that can be integrated into my current day-to-day activities.
